Advanced AWS

Chapter 10: Advanced AWS

 

The Core PHP Scripts

The shell script core-php-examples invokes the php scripts from the chapter.
Read the chapter and the script to see what's going on.

You'll have to download your own usage statistics as csv files to run most of
these.  Do that here.

The example assumes you'll download your own EC2 and S3 usage data and call
them ec2_usage.csv and s3_usage.csv. The book suggests choosing "All Usage
Types," with "Hours" as the granularity.

I've modified the queries so they're not tied to dates from when the text was
being written.

bucket_usage.phpbucket_usage_page.php, like the _page scripts in Chapter 4, is
intended for the server's html/ directory, to be run by the web server.
basic-examples cheats, invoking the script from the command-line and then
invoking a browser to look at the output.  Without being run by the web server,
the page isn't pretty, but the concept is clear.

It displays a particular set of usage data for the last week.  When I ran it,
hadn't done enough in that time period to be interesting, so I parameterized
the number of days. If you, too, want to modify the number of days to search
through, look for $ndays in the script.

Amazon SimpleDB

Chapter 8: Amazon SimpleDB, A Cloud Database

 

AWS SimpleDB (SDB) lets you create and maintain databases that you can add to
and do SQL queries on without a lot of work. There are no normal forms or
joins.  On the flip side, you don’t have to pre-define all the columns of each
table -- not all rows even have to have the same columns, and you can change
your mind on the fly. Plus, they can be big -- terabytes. To me, this seems
potentially useful.

 

I’ve never been a hard-core database guy, so I’m sure there are more, clever
and interesting things to say here, but I’m not the guy to say them.  If you
can say them, please do so here.

 

The code in this chapter has been converted to AWSSDKforPHP and mostly works
for me.  As always, I’ve tried to make minimal modifications, and not stray too
far from the code supplied, rather than “improve” it in gratuitous ways. My
goal is to make it easier for you to get through the book, not to interject my
own ideas. :-)

 

The script basic-sdb-examples shows off all the basic examples in the book.

A couple of caveats worth noting:

 

 + This won't work:

 

query_domain_cmd,php "Size < '00000900'"

 

You have to say this:

 

query_domain_cmd,php "Size<'00000900'"

 

Whitespace matters.

 

This, however, works:

 

query_domain_cmd,php "Size = '00000900'"

 

Go figure.

 

 + This (from the book) won’t work, either:

 

query_domain_cmd.php "itemName() in ('disable_mon.php','list_metrics.php')"

because there are no such files.

 

 

The script complex-sdb-example shows off the stuff at the end. There seem to be
nondeterministic hiccups when you run it, but I haven’t investigated.  If you
figure out how to make the examples run more smoothly, let me know.

Chapter 6 is code to use the AWS Simple Queueing Service.

Try the code in this order:

list_queues.php			# no queues
create_queues.php q1 q2 q3	# three queues
list_queues.php			# should see them

(The list_all_queues.php script looks like an older version of list_queues.php, and is superfluous.)

All the queue names are URLs, though your browser can't actually get to them. (Try it if you want to see for yourself.)

The names are a bit long, so set a variable name to one.

Q=$(list_queues.php | sed 1q)   # capture the name of one queue

Now use it.

post_queue.php $Q m1 m2 m3 m4
pull_queue.php $Q

The messages may not be pulled in the order you posted them, and pull_queue.php is an infinite loop.

Perhaps you're thinking, "But I don't know PHP." That's okay. I don't either. It's part of the great family of C-like languages. Modifying the code to change it a little, or even pasting a whole program together out of fragments of the code sample is easy enough. When it isn't, Google is your friend.

There's a command-line interpreter, /usr/bin/php, and a library installer and maintainer, /usr/bin/pear

There is, however, a rub.

Some Scripts Don't Work

Three scripts in the chapter_04/ directory aren't meant to be run from the command line.

list_bucket_objects_page.php
list_bucket_objects_page_thumbs.php
list_buckets_page.php

They have no shebang (#!) line, and their names all have "_page".  They generate web pages.

If you stick them in /var/www/ and point at them with your browser, they don't work because the "require_once()" statements fail. They can't find the files they need.

Making the "_page" Scripts Work

install a web browser

sudo apt-get install apache2

There's instructions on how to get this all set up hither and yon that I won't duplicate. Google's your friend.

put the files into /var/www

cd code/chapter_04
sudo cp -r include *_page* /var/www

make a new /usr/share/php/config.inc.php

sudo su -
# cd /var/www/AWSSDKforPHP/
# cp config.inc.php config.inc.php.cli
# cp config-sample.inc.php config.inc.php.gui

put your actual AWS_KEY and AWS_SECRET_KEY values into this config file

# vi config.inc.php.gui

# cp config.inc.php.gui config.inc.php

Now, it'll work. Ugh.

Is there a better way to do this? Show me how.

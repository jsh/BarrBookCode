Chapter 11: Putting It All Together: CloudList

 

The book title is Host Your Web Site in the Cloud.  Really, it could be called
Amazon Web Services Step-by-Step, since it takes you from nothing to basic
understanding of a big topic. Once you understand all the pieces, constructing
the web site and putting it in the cloud’s pretty straightforward.

 

Nevertheless, to cap off his book, Jeff Barr shows us how it’s done by creating
a sample web site in the cloud.

 

How straightforward is it?

 

$ wc -l *.php

  65 add_category.php
  65 add_city.php
  81 add_form.php
  70 add_item.php
  72 cloudlist.php
  50 create_domain.php
  62 delete_items.php
  53 dump.php
 518 total

Eight PHP scripts, none much more than a screen in length.

Oh, okay, there are files in include/, too.

 

$ wc -l include/*

  69 include/addform.html.php
  33 include/addthanks.html.php
 322 include/cloudfunctions.inc.php
  62 include/cloudlist.html.php
 486 total

The big one is filled with utility functions you’ve already seen in include/
book.inc.php, from earlier chapters. The rest are web pages with embedded PHP.

 

Running the Example Code

 

The shell script test-cli-scripts verifies that the six CLI PHP scripts work
and shows how to invoke them.

 

To run the app, you need to

 + start a LAMP instance to host your website,
 2. ssh into it to set up some AWS infrastructure (the things you went through
    in the ‘Chapter 0’ notes)
 3. put some PHP scripts from this chapter where Apache can find them.

 

The shell script desktop-steps shows how to do this on the desktop side.

 

Once you’ve ssh’d into the LAMP instance, running the cloudlist-setup script,
which (desktop-setup has already copied over) illustrates the remaining steps.
The Barr book explains it all and walks you through the PHP.

 

You can see it in action by pointing your browser at http://<dnsname of your
instance>/cloudlist.php and putting it through its paces.

 

For some reason, I’m having permission problems with access to the jpegs. If
you figure this out before I do, please provide the fix.

 

Bye. It’s Been Fun.

 

That’s all folks.
